# JpFakeOS

The fake operating system app is a web-based app that imitates the look and feel of the popular Windows XP operating system. It includes a desktop with a Start menu, taskbar, and various desktop icons and widgets. Users can launch and interact with fake applications, such as a web browser, text editor, and media player. The app also includes a range of features that are inspired by Windows XP, such as a system tray, task manager, and control panel. The app was built using JavaScript, HTML, SCSS, and CSS, and is designed to be a fun and nostalgiac tribute to the classic operating system.
